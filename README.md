Overview:
This white paper explores a next-generation Operating System (OS) tailored for small AI models in financial trading systems, focusing on the use of tensor-based optimization to minimize energy consumption, latency, and future costs. It also integrates advanced concepts like  consensus mechanisms, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKProof) to ensure that the system operates efficiently and securely in real-time trading environments.
